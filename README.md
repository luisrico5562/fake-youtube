# Fake YouTube
This personal project tries to replicate the main page on YouTube, as well as the watch page (which allows the user to watch a video). 

The goal of this project is to challenge my HTML, CSS, and JS skills, trying to make the webpage look as good as the one it is inspired from.

Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS (MVC)

This project uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.

No frameworks were used on this project.
